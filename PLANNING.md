# AI Therapeutic Chat App - Project Planning

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: EverKind - AI Therapeutic Voice Assistant  
**Mission**: Provide accessible, evidence-based CBT therapy through a low-latency voice AI interface that delivers human-like therapeutic conversations.

**Core Vision**: Create a modular, scalable therapeutic AI system that combines the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with cutting-edge voice AI technology to provide immediate, personalized mental health support.

## Architecture & Design Principles

### Modular Architecture
- **Microservices-based design** for scalability and maintainability
- **Plugin architecture** for easy addition of new therapy modules
- **API-first approach** for future integrations
- **Event-driven architecture** for real-time processing

### Low-Latency Voice Optimization
Based on industry best practices for voice AI systems:

1. **WebSocket & Streaming APIs**: Continuous data transmission vs HTTP request-response
2. **Local Model Integration**: Reduce third-party API calls where possible
3. **Optimized LLM Layer**: Use small, specialized models for classification + pre-saved responses
4. **Audio Optimization**: 
   - Pre-recorded common responses (greetings, acknowledgments)
   - Optimized audio encoding and reduced payload sizes
   - Lower sample rates where appropriate
5. **Filler Sentences**: Immediate acknowledgments while processing ("Let me think about that...")
6. **Partial Transcript Processing**: Make decisions on incomplete user input when possible

**Target Latency**: 500-700ms end-to-end response time

### Technology Stack

#### Backend
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Framework**: FastAPI for high-performance APIs
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy/SQLModel ORM
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for voice streaming

#### AI/ML Components
- **Speech-to-Text**: OpenAI Whisper (local) + fallback to cloud APIs
- **Text-to-Speech**: ElevenLabs/Azure Cognitive Services with local caching
- **LLM**: 
  - Primary: GPT-4 Turbo for complex reasoning
  - Secondary: Llama 3.2 3B for fast classification tasks
  - Local: Fine-tuned models for common CBT responses
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone/Weaviate for therapy session context

#### Frontend
